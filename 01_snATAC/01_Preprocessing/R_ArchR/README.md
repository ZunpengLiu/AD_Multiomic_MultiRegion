This script processes ATAC-seq fragment files to create Arrow files for downstream analysis with ArchR. The steps include:
1. Loading fragment data.
2. Generating Arrow files with quality control metrics such as transcription start site (TSS) enrichment and gene score matrices.
3. Adding doublet scores to identify potential doublets in the single-cell data.

## Dependencies

The following R packages are required to run the script:

- `GenomicRanges`
- `ArchR`
- `stringr`
- `dplyr`
- `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38`
